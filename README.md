# Portfolio - Martin Labato
Personal portfolio


## Overview
As a previous stage I designed a sketch on Figma (https://www.figma.com/file/8Tam5o0KlWeiyw06m9pSAV/Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1)  
I chose a color palette on https://coolors.co/.  
Then I built the webpage as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React. For the styling I relied on Tailwind.css and React Icons.


## Framework
React  

## Extra libraries  
Tailwind  
React Icons  

## Run this sample!
- Run npm install
- Clone this repository
- Run npm start

The app was deployed using Vercel and can be found in the following link:
